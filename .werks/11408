Additional to "Input bandwith" and "Output bandwidth" metrics, a "Total
bandwidth" metric, that sums up the incoming and outcoming traffic, can
now be activated for network interface checks.

You can activate the metric by applying the "Used total bandwidth (in + out)
(minimum or maximum traffic)" checkbox within the "Network interfaces and switch
ports" ruleset. There, you can also optionally set levels, that work the same
way as the do for the input and output bandwidth metrics.
